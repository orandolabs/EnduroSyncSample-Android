This is a sample of EnduroSync for Android. Some notes:

1. You should probably replace app/libs/endurosynclib.jar with the most recent version which can be found [here](https://orandolabs.com/#!/developer).

2. In MainActivity.java, there are several static Strings that you need to replace with your own values (kNs, kApp, etc.)

3. This sample works well with the iOS sample. If you run this sample, and 
then run the iOS sample (or vice versa), you'll get a synced object store.

4. The sample is a simple named preferences object that contains some prefereneces and a list of link objects.
